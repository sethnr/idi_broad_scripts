#IDI broad scripts 
This archive is miscellaneous vcf/sam/etc scripts I've found useful. They are provided here in case anybody else does too. They come with the usual warnings and caveats. As time goes by many of them will become out of date, or generally just stop working. 

If run without any variables, all scripts in here *should* give a brief overview of the script and an example command line. 
running, eg, `python myScriptName.py --help` should give you details of individual options

## vcf
